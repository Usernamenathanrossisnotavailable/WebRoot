            Hello, my name is Nathan Ross.<br>
            I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Software Development and Applications from Bellevue College, and I completed an internship at Pipworks Studio in Eugene. I'm passionate about game design, particulary combat-related games.<br>
            As an avid programmer, I have experience with a variey of programming languages and excel at solving complex problems with optimal solutions. I have a proven attention to detail in individual coding tasks and always strive for near perfection in everything I do.<br>
            I'm committed to delivering high-quality work and thrive in fast-paced environments. I'm a quick learner, enjoy collaborating with high-functioning task-driven teams, and love learning from other programmers.<br>
            I also bring a creative, outside-the-box approach to problem-solving, such as designing a video game for a visually impaired person for my STEM project in college.
